# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this repository is to create an analysis for my clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market by using unsupervised learning to process the data, cluster, reduce the dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA

The data we are working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, we are using unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies we are using a clustering algorithm and data visualizations
